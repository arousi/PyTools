## Current Scripts
### **start at `main.py`**
1. Open a terminal in the PyTools directory.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to select the mode (CLI or GUI) and the tool you want to run.
   - If you select CLI mode, ensure the source file is placed inside the root directory.
   - If you select GUI mode, a file-picker dialog will appear for you to select the source file.

### 3. PDF Text Extraction Script `PDF2Text.py`
   This script extracts text from PDF files, using OCR if necessary, and allows for the exclusion of specific strings from the output. 
- Features:
  
    - Tesseract OCR Installation: Checks for Tesseract OCR installation and provides a link to download it if not installed.
    
    - Filename Sanitization: Sanitizes filenames by removing unnecessary quotes and invalid characters.
    
    - Text Extraction: Extracts text from PDF files using pdfplumber and falls back to OCR using pytesseract if no embedded text is found.
    
    - Directory Listing: Lists files in the script's directory for easy selection.

Any executable will be flagged by the antivirus, to stop that i needed to pay a fee for an orgnization providing a key signing service, Thus just "Add Exception" or run `python script-name.py` in your terminal

How to open Terminal?

Go to your downloaded/cloned scripts file, in the top side of the 'File Explorer' write cmd then Enter, do `python script-name.py`

voiala congrats you are now a hacker!
### **Using the Script**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arousi/PyTools.git
   ```
2. Double click the `reqs.bat` file:
   ```bash
   python 3.11 and all required libraries for all scripts will be installed
   ```
3. Navigate to /scripts or go to Releases for the noobs <3
